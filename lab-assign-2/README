Exploiting unlink bug.
Providing two exploits (exploit_v1.sh, exploit_v2.sh)

[exploit_v1.sh]
 - Overwrite strcmp function's got by an address (in heap region) of shellcode that consists of two instructions (mov %eax, $0; ret;)
 - Since the address space is randomized, fixing a specific base address (for heap region) and doing brute force

[exploit_v2.sh]
 - Simply overwrite the write_here variable (0x0804b888) by an address of string "jacket!"
